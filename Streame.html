      <p style="text-align:center;">Many Platforms are used for streaming content, vlogging, gaming, mukbang, and etc, but mostly people use YouTube especially in the Philippines, while Twitch uses it in the US.
This are the types of Platforms that's used for streaming:

 <p><strong>YouTube</strong> -  is one of the most popular online platforms that can also be used for streaming, vlogging, documentaries, and other purposes. YouTube platforms are well-known in the United States, and many of them use it for vlogging, streaming, and teaching lessons, primarily in math. According to my research, roughly seven-in-ten Americans (71 percent) use the YouTube platform for them to know the previous happenings in the world like news, documentaries, teaching skills about school, and etc. Accounting for roughly a quarter of all U.S. YouTube has become a place for news and commentary from a variety of sources. Americans who get their news from YouTube are roughly divided into two groups: those who seek opinions and social commentary and those who seek information and facts, according to the Pew Research survey.

 <p><strong>Twitch</strong> -  According to my research, live streaming platforms such as twitch that facilitate participatory online communities have become a literal part of the game culture. Users of these platforms are mostly teenagers and young adults who prefer to socialize online rather than in person. On the one hand, platforms like Twitch provide enjoyment, distraction, and connectedness with others to aid in coping, as well as an improved sense of anonymity. Also twitch is a live streaming that focuses on video games. It was founded by Justin kan in 2011, originally as a spin-off of justin.tv. The latter started life in 2007 as a single channel, broadcasting kanâ€™s life live around the clock, pioneering the concept of lifecasting. The website drew attention from others who were more interested in broadcasting their own lives than watching Kan's, but it provided great exposure for justin.tv. In response to this interest, the site relaunched later that year, allowing users to create their own channels and broadcast their own content via the platform. Streaming game was not the original idea, but after seeing the interest from many users wanting to stream video games, the gaming category of justin.TV was spun-out as Twitch.TV. As more and more gameplay is broadcast online, game culture has expanded beyond actively playing games.

 <p><strong>Instagram</strong> -  Many people say that it's good to try a live stream on Instagram because it's easy and your friends can join the live too, and based on the article that I see (80 percent) audiences would rather watch a live stream than read a blog post, while (82 percent) audiences would rather watch a live stream than see a social media post, and finally (67 percent) audiences would rather watch a live stream that you will buy. I noticed a number of individuals conducting live streaming on Instagram from time to time, so I joined them and enjoyed their live stream

 <p><strong>Periscope</strong> -  According to my research, people believe that the entire live broadcasting and live connection with other people, or what we must term "viewers," is operating very well, and that starting a broadcasting is quite simple. You can share your live broadcasting or streaming on Twitter, and you can limit the number of comments from people. If the webcast or broadcast begins, it will be simple to remark and ask questions. Other than the benefits of being a Periscope streamer or broadcaster, the website has some drawbacks, according to users, because it's tough to determine if a user is active or not, and you don't know how frequently they post or if they're using the account anymore.

 <p><strong>USTREAM</strong> -  So I do my research and based on the website that I find and read, the viewers were previously satisfied, very well, good, and easy to use it; however, when the year 2021 arrives and they need to update the USTREAM website, the streaming became worse and really bad to use it; many people are complaining that the entire website became worse and not good to use it; however, some say that they hope that the old USTREAM website returns, because it is truly to live strewn.
